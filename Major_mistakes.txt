few last exams major mistakes --->

1. Datetime API mistakes, but not conceptual.
2. Wrapper class (always remember, if right type of value is provided then it will do auto boxing and unboxing properly.)
3. read about string and StringBUilder methods carefully.
example:- 
public void ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity)
Ensures that the capacity is at least equal to the specified minimum. If the current capacity is less than the argument, then a new internal array is allocated with greater capacity. The new capacity is the larger of: 
The minimumCapacity argument. 
Twice the old capacity, plus 2. 
If the minimumCapacity argument is nonpositive, this method takes no action and simply returns.
Observe that the question says "at least 100 characters". In the exam, you may get a question that says "100 characters", in that case, ensureCapacity() may not be a valid option.
