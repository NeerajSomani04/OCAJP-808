1. B, C (N)
--> A reference variable of Derived (Child) class can't be used to refer an object of base (parent) class.
example:- 
class Animal {}
class Lion extends Animal implements Jumpable {}
--> you can explicitely cast any object to an interface, even if it doesn't implement it to make the compile. but if the object's class doesn't implement interface, the code will throw ClassCaseException at runtime.
example:-
interface Jumpable {}
Jumpable var6 = (Jumpable)(new Animal()); // runtime exception

--> remember below defaulty value for all primitive type --> 
--> char - \u0000 | byte,short,int - 0 | long - 0L | 
--> float - 0.0f | double - 0.0d | boolean - false | objects - null
--> but when these value passed to print method it will print without specific data type charachter (exmple, for float it will print 0.0, for long it will print 0, etc.)
--> Remember, you can't pass an uninitialized variable directly to print statement. (long ln; System.out.println(ln); // does not compile) --> we need to either initialze it or use it with class object (because java will initialze it then)  
12. A (N)
A reference variable of base class can't access variable and methods of child class without explicit cast. The best way to do that is:
--> ((LaserPrinter) myPrinter).pagePerMin; // casting to subclass
13. B (N)
--> The local variable (variables that are declared within a method) aren't initialzed with their default values. If you try to print the value of a local variable before initializing it, the code won't compile. 
--> On the other side, class and instance variable, initialize variable with default value.

17. B (N)
---> Always remember, if a main method needs to access a variable directly it must be static. or the variable can be access via instance variable.
--> because, a non-static variable can't be accessed via static method.
18. B (N)
--> Creation of an object of the class Emp requires the creation of an instance variable mgr and its initialization with an object of the same class. Hence, Emp object creation calls itself recusrsively, resulting in StackOverFlowError.
--> this is very tricky question. understand it through book explanation only. if above statement doesn't make sense.

20. A, B, D (N)
--> An array declaration becomes invalid, when you specify the size of  array within square bracket and declaring, instantiating and initializing an array at the single line of code.
example:-
int eArry5[] = new int[2] {10,20}; // this is invalid
int[] eArry2 = new int[10]; // valid
int eArry3[] = new int[] {}; // empty declaration is also valid

--> A constructor can't be defined using a non-access modifiers like, final, abstract or static
--> A constructor can't be defined with return type

--> very tricky and nice question, need to understand it multiple time
--> concept, if you modify the state of the loop variable, the modified object state will be reflected in the array. but if you assign a new object to the loop variable, it won't be reflected in the list or the array that's being iterated. you can compare this behavior of the enhanced for loop variable with the behavior of object references passed as arguments to a method.
30. B (N) -- Re
--> static method of a class are hidden methods
--> calling static method is tied to the type of the reference variable and doesn't depend on the type of the object that's assigned to the reference variable. The static method belongs to a class and not to its objects. 
31. A, C, D

--> Substring method of String class can't accept negative value. (for example: str.substring(2, -1) will throw runtime exception).
37. B, E (N)
--> When an object reference is marked as null, the object is marked for garbage collection. But you can't be sure exactly when a garbage collector will kick in to garbage collect the objects. A garbage collector is low-priority thread, its execution depends on OS> you can never be sure about which object have been garbage collected. you can only be sure about how many objects are eligible for garbage collection.
38. A (N)
--> remember, equals method is a public method defined in java.lang.Object class, which is inherited by all classes. but default implementation of equals method is to compare the object reference pointing to same object, then return TRUE else FALSE. Any class can override this method to implement other logic. Here, no override happneded.
--> Need to check in general which classes overrides equals() method. 
39. A, C (N)
--> There is no concat method in StringBuilder. There is append method in StringBuilder to append any string.
--> Also, insert method can be used to insert char, number, or String at any specified position of StringBuilder.

--> break; statement breaks the execution of current loop. means, if you have a loop that should execute from 0 to 9 and you hit break; statement at 5 position then loop will not run for any value after 5, means from 6 to 9.
--> continue; statment, if you hit continue statment at 5 position, it will stop the current execution but continue run of loop from 6 to 9 value iteration.
--> also, remember, this break or continue statements are for iteration of loops (for, do, while) and not for if-else statement.

52. B -- Re
--> any non-static method when inherited and overridden, reference variable refers to the objects created for that class. means, reference variable will refer to method based on object and not based on reference variable.
