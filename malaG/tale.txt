1.1 --> C, D
A .java file must have only one public class or one public interface, and file name should be the same as public class or interface. A .java file can have multiple class or interfaces.

1.2 --> A, C, D

1.3 --> A, B

1.4 --> shreya (N) --> The Top-level class or primary class within any .java file can't be declared with private or protected access modifiers.
The primary class in a .java file must be public or package protected (default) class.
Also, notice if a class is package protected means its by default not visible outside package. Programmer has to import the package and extend the class in-order to use this class. Hence, default access modifier makes class invisible outside package.

2.1 --> 
The underscore can't be placed in between (0_x or 0_b) or even just after the initials (0b_10 or 0x_25). only exception it can be placed after first 0 (ex:- 0_1010_11). For hexaDecimal values the letter can be till f or F only, G and further is not allowed.

2.2 --> A, B, C, E
--> remember, when you have to select all incorrect answers means, select all false statement.
 
2.3 --> 32
11 + 11 + 10 - 9 + 9 
2.4 --> 
line 1 --> true (both will evaluate)
line 2 --> false (only first will evaluate)
line 3 --> fasle (only first)
line 4 --> false (all will evaluate)
line 5 --> false (only first expression for && clause and then right part of || will also evaluate)

short-circuit operators --> 
&& --> if first expression is false then it won't evaluate second expression.
|| --> if first expression is true then it won't evaluate second expression.

3.1 --> A
3.2 --> infinite loop, as construtor calling itself. code fails to compile with the error stating recursive constructor invocation
3.3 --> E

4.1 --> A
4.2 --> D
4.3 --> B, C, D
