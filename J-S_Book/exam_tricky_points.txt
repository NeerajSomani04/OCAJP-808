from ch 2 -->
1. questions on the exam that try to apply a logical complement operator, !, to a numeric expression, and a negation operator, -, to a boolean expression. cause the code to fail to compile.
2. pay attention to questions that use Increment and decrement operators, ++ and --, on the same variable multiple time in same statement.
3. short-circuit operators or conditional operators, && and ||, --> the right-hand side of the expression may never be evaluated if the final result can be determined by the left-hand side of the expression.
4. Pay close attention to the data types when you see an equality operator (== and !=) on the exam. The exam creators also have a habit of mixing assignment operators and equality operators.
5. during the OCA exam, you may be pre- sented with classnames that are unfamiliar, such as File. Many times you can answer ques- tions about these classes without knowing the specific details of these classes. 
6. exam writers trick on if-then statements without braces ({}). 
  In below example, print statement will run only when if condition satisfied. but incrementing variable will always run, not dependent on if statement.
if(hourOfDay < 11) 
  System.out.println("Good Morning"); 
  morningGreetingCount++;
7. Another exam writers trick on if-then statements is, providing code where the boolean expression inside the if-then statement is not actually a boolean expression. For example,
int x = 1;
if(x) { // DOES NOT COMPILE
....
}
8. No paranthesis applied to ternary oprator expression, as its an optional. 
9. exam tricks --> only one of the right-hand expressions of the ternary operator will be evaluated at runtime. Means, if boolean expression is true then 1st expression will only evaluate at run-time and if boolean expression is false then 2nd expression.
Its very similar to short-circuit operators.
int x = y<10 ? y++ : z++; // only one will increment, either y or z based on y value
10.
