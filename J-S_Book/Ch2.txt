Chapter 2 -- Operators and Statements

--- Understanding Java Operators --
it is a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables, values, or literals—referred to as operands—and that returns a result.
3 types --> unary, binary, and ternary
Java operators are not necessarily evaluated from left-to-right order.

Unless overridden with parentheses, Java operators follow order of operation from higher-to-lower precedence.
If two operators have the same level of precedence, then Java guarantees left-to-right evaluation.

Order of operator     precedence
Operator   ----------->      Symbols and examples
Post-unary operators   ----------->       expression++, expression--
Pre-unary operators   ----------->       ++expression, --expression
Other unary operators   ----------->       +, -, !
Multiplication/Division/Modulus   ----------->       *, /, %
Addition/Subtraction   ----------->      +, -
Shift operators   ----------->      <<, >>, >>>  (// not in OCA exam)
Relational operators   ----------->      <, >, <=, >=, instanceof
Equal to/not equal to   ----------->      ==, !=
Logical operators   ----------->      &, ^, |
Short-circuit logical operators   ----------->      &&, ||
Ternary operators   ----------->      boolean expression ? expression1 : expression2
Assignment operators   ----------->      =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, ^=, !=, <<=, >>=, >>>=


---- Working with Binary Arithmetic Operators --> used to perform mathematical operations on variables, create logical expressions, as well as perform basic variable assignments.

  --- Arithmetic Operators --> 

switch statement 
Data types supported by switch statements include the following:
■ int and Integer wrapper class
■ byte and Byte wrapper class
■ short and Short wrapper class
■ char and Character wrapper class
■ String
■ enum values

Note that boolean and long, and their associated wrapper classes, are not supported by switch statements.

default block --> if there is no matching case value for the switch statement, regardless of its position.

the data type for case statements must all match the data type of the switch variable.
the case statement value must be a literal, enum constant, or final constant variable.
