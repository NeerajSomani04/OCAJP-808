<-- String -->
  Concatenation --> 3 rules 
    1. If both operands are numeric, + means numeric addition.
    2. If either operand is a String, + means concatenation.
    3. The expression is evaluated left to right.

  Immutability -> (unchangable)
    String objects can't be changed once created.

  The String Pool --> is a location in the Java virtual machine (JVM)  that collects all these strings.
    It contains literal values.
