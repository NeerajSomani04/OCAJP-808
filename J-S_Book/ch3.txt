Core Java APIs:-  API (Application Programming Interface)
Interface:- Consist of classes and interfaces that provide some functionality or service.

String 
StringBuilder
ArrayList

<-- String -->
  Concatenation --> 3 rules 
    1. If both operands are numeric, + means numeric addition.
    2. If either operand is a String, + means concatenation.
    3. The expression is evaluated left to right.

  Immutability -> (unchangable)
    String objects can't be changed once created.

  The String Pool --> is a location in the Java virtual machine (JVM)  that collects all these strings.
    It contains literal values.
  Important String Methods --> 
    length() --> returns the number of characters in the String.
    charAt() --> lets you query the string using index value, 
    indexOf() --> indexOf can work with an individual character or a whole String as input. 
        indexOf() returns â€“1 when no match is found.
      The method signatures are as follows:
        int indexOf(char ch)
        int indexOf(char ch, index fromIndex)
        int indexOf(String str)
        int indexOf(String str, index fromIndex)
     substring() --> returns parts of the string.
      The method signatures are as follows:
        int substring(int beginIndex)
        int substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) // endIndex is non-inclusive
