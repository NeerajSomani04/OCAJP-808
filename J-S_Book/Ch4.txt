chapter 4 - Methods and Encapsulation

Method signature and its components -->
  Access Modifiers -->
    public --> The method can be called from any class.
    private --> The method can only be called from within the same class.
    protected --> The method can only be called from classes in the same package or subclasses.
    Default (Package Private) Access --> The method can only be called from classes in the same package.
      There is no "default" keyword and hence we don't need to specify this in method declaration.
