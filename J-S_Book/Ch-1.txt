An object is a runtime instance of a class in memory
Objects of classes represents state of program. (Need more understanding on this statement)
Variables hold the state of the program, and methods operate on that state.
The keyword static binds a method to its class so it can be called by just the class name, as in, for example, Zoo.main().
